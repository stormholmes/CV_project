# Sample Visualization
In this directiry, /baseline and /LF both contain 29 sample pictures, with same filename illustrating the same sample. In each picture:

the upper left is the input image with a few exemplar boxes,

the upper right with green boxes is the ground truth,

and the bottom left is model prediction outputs with highlighted object centers and yellow bounding boxes.

\#GT-\#PRED is the deviation of count from prediction to ground truth, where possitive value stands for undercounting and negative is overcounting.

Here, /baseline contains the outputs from baseline GeCo, and /LF contains the ones from our redesigned model GeCo-LF.
