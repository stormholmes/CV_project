# Sample Visualization
In this directiry, /baseline and /LF both contain 29 sample pictures, with same filename illustrating the same sample. In each picture:
the upper left is the input image with a few exemplar boxes,
the upper right with green boxes is the ground truth,
the bottom left is model prediction outputs.
Here, /baseline contains the outputs from baseline GeCo, and /LF contains the ones from our redesigned model GeCo-LF.
